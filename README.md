# VIDE - VI IDE

## Objective

The aim of this repo is to create a minimun set of vim and shell script that provides the user with a pre-costumized IDE for VIM.

The scripts provides integration with other useful repos for AI interaction, code completion and more.

The name VIDE was chosen for in french it means "void". This is the philosophy behind it. The minimun (even the void is filled with something) amount of things VI needs to provides users with something closer to an IDE.
