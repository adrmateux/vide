# vide
This is vide. A very simplified ide that uses vim as it's main editor.

The philosophy behind it is to make vide as simplest as possible, without depending package based programing framework, like Node.js/python, wich may introduce dependencies on "god only knows what the hell of s... they will try to stick in your a.."

Nonetheless, there are some dependencies:
* ctags
* cscope
* CCTree
* vim-cpp-enhanced-highligh
